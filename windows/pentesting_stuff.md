### Powershell
The script below show how to create a session or invoke a command on a remote machine. An alternative to creating the credential variable is using the `Get-Credential` cmdlet, although it creates an external window to obtain the creds, not ideal if you have only a terminal to work with.
```
$username = "domain\user_name"
$password = Read-Host -Prompt "Password:" -AsSecureString
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($username, $password)
$session = New-PSSession -ComputerName PC_NAME_01 -Credential $cred
Invoke-Command -Session $session -ScriptBlock {command}
Enter-PSSession -Session $session -verbose
```
